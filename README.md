# whist
<p> This Whist game, written in Python, is inspired from the classic English card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whist">Whist (Wikipedia)</a></p>
<p> Whist is played by four players, in teams of two. This game currently has one player controlled player and three computer controlled players. Teams have not been implemented yet, but is a Todo item. This game represents my first attempt at creating a game, and is played on the command line.
